Your goal is to generate doc-strings for all functions, methods, or classes within the selected code snippet.

Requirements for the doc-strings are:
* Describe the purpose and functionality of the functions, methods, or classes.
* For small functions (less than 10 lines of code), the doc-string should consist of one or two sentences, do not use a NumPy-style doc-string.
* For large functions (10 or more lines of code), use a NumPy-style doc-string.
* Include descriptions of parameters and return values.
* If the function is complex, feel free to add simple examples of how to use the function.
* Mention any exceptions that the function might raise, if applicable.
